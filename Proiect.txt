# Slot Machine Simulation Project

## Introduction
Our project simulates a slot machine game using a hardware platform. This game is a replica of a slot machine.

### What the project does
The project allows users to experience the basic mechanics of a slot game. By pressing a button, an animation symbolizing the run is triggered, and the result is displayed by a combination of emojis.

### The purpose of the project
The project is educational. Also, the goal is to provide an engaging experience to the user while learning about the logic of gambling.

### The idea from which I started
I proposed to combine entertainment with education, using a well-known concept - slot machine. The idea was inspired by the popularity of gambling, but with an emphasis on simplicity and safety, without financial implications.

### Why it's useful
It is useful because it can help gambling addicts to play without financial implications.

## General Description
The project consists of an integrated hardware and software system simulating a slot machine game. Below is an overview of the key modules and their interactions.

### System Components
1. **Hardware**:
   - **LED RGB**: Displays animations to simulate the spinning of slot machine reels and results.
   - **Buttons**: One for starting the game (start) and another for resetting or changing difficulty.
   - **Arduino Uno**: The central controller managing game logic and hardware interactions.
   - **Resistors and Jumper Wires**: Ensure proper circuit connections.

2. **Software**:
   - **Arduino Firmware**: Implements game logic, randomization algorithms, and visual effects using C++ in the Arduino IDE.
   - **Randomization Algorithm**: Generates winning or losing combinations.
   - **Serial Interface**: Outputs debug messages or game results for additional feedback.

### How It Works
- **User Interaction**: Pressing the start button triggers the slot animation.
- **Processing**: The Arduino processes the randomization algorithm to determine results.
- **Output**: Results are displayed using RGB LEDs and optionally in the serial monitor.
