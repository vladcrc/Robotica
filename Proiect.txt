# Slot Machine Simulation Project

## Introduction
Our project simulates a slot machine game using a hardware platform. This game is a replica of a slot machine.

### What the project does
The project allows users to experience the basic mechanics of a slot game. By pressing a button, an animation symbolizing the run is triggered, and the result is displayed by a combination of emojis.

### The purpose of the project
The project is educational. Also, the goal is to provide an engaging experience to the user while learning about the logic of gambling.

### The idea from which I started
I proposed to combine entertainment with education, using a well-known concept - slot machine. The idea was inspired by the popularity of gambling, but with an emphasis on simplicity and safety, without financial implications.

### Why it's useful
It is useful because it can help gambling addicts to play without financial implications.
